# Security Guide

This document outlines security best practices and guidelines for the Developer Portfolio Dashboard project.

## Overview

Security is a critical aspect of any web application, especially one that handles user authentication and content management. This guide covers security measures implemented in the project and best practices for maintaining security in development and production environments.

## Environment Variable Security

### Development vs Production Keys

**Development Environment:**
- Use test keys with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` prefixes
- Store in `.env.local` (never commit to version control)
- Safe to use in local development and testing

**Production Environment:**
- Use live keys with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_` prefixes
- Store securely in deployment platform environment variables
- Never commit to version control or expose in client-side code

### Key Management Best Practices

1. **Separation of Environments**
   ```bash
   # Development (.env.local)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_development_key_here
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_development_key_here
   
   # Production (Deployment Platform)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_production_key_here
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_production_key_here
   ```

2. **Documentation Security**
   - Always use placeholder values in documentation
   - Never include actual keys in example configurations
   - Use descriptive placeholder names (e.g., `your_key_here`)

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit access to production keys to essential team members
   - Use role-based access in your deployment platform
   - Implement audit logging for key access

4. **Key Rotation**
   - Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
   - Update webhook secrets periodically
   - Monitor for any unauthorized key usage

## Authentication Security

### Clerk Integration Security

1. **Domain Configuration**
   - Configure allowed domains in Clerk dashboard
   - Use HTTPS for all authentication endpoints
   - Implement proper CORS policies

2. **JWT Security**
   - Use short-lived tokens (60 seconds recommended)
   - Implement proper token validation
   - Use secure signing algorithms

3. **Session Management**
   - Implement proper session timeout
   - Use secure session storage
   - Clear sessions on logout

### Role-Based Access Control

1. **Admin Verification**
   - Database-backed admin role verification
   - Server-side role checks for all admin operations
   - Proper error handling for unauthorized access

2. **Route Protection**
   - Middleware-based route protection
   - Client-side and server-side validation
   - Graceful handling of authentication failures

## Database Security

### Connection Security

1. **SSL/TLS Encryption**
   - Always use SSL connections to database
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Use connection pooling with proper security

2. **Access Control**
   - Use dedicated database users with minimal privileges
   - Implement network-level access restrictions
   - Regular security updates and patches

### Query Security

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   ```typescript
   // Good: Parameterized queries
   const result = await db.query(
     'SELECT * FROM projects WHERE id = $1',
     [projectId]
   )
   
   // Bad: String concatenation
   const result = await db.query(
     `SELECT * FROM projects WHERE id = ${projectId}`
   )
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before database operations
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

## API Security

### Request Validation

1. **Input Sanitization**
   ```typescript
   import { sanitizeInput } from '@/lib/security'
   
   const cleanTitle = sanitizeInput(request.title)
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Different limits for public vs authenticated endpoints
   - Monitor and alert on rate limit violations

3. **Security Headers**
   ```typescript
   const SECURITY_HEADERS = {
     'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
     'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
     'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
     'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
   }
   ```

### File Upload Security

1. **File Validation**
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Scan for malicious content
   - Use secure file storage

2. **Access Control**
   - Authenticate file upload requests
   - Implement proper file permissions
   - Regular cleanup of orphaned files

## Client-Side Security

### XSS Prevention

1. **Content Sanitization**
   - Sanitize user-generated content
   - Use proper escaping in templates
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

2. **Safe Rendering**
   ```typescript
   // Good: Safe rendering
   <div>{sanitizedContent}</div>
   
   // Bad: Dangerous HTML injection
   <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userContent}} />
   ```

### CSRF Protection

1. **Token Validation**
   - Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
   - Validate tokens on server-side
   - Implement proper token rotation

## Infrastructure Security

### Deployment Security

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Separate development, staging, and production environments
   - Use different credentials for each environment
   - Implement proper access controls

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Monitor authentication attempts
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity

### Network Security

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement HSTS headers
   - Use secure cookie settings

2. **Domain Security**
   - Configure proper DNS security
   - Use domain validation for SSL certificates
   - Implement subdomain security policies

## Security Monitoring

### Logging and Alerting

1. **Security Events**
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Unusual API usage patterns
   - Database connection failures

2. **Monitoring Tools**
   - Application performance monitoring
   - Security scanning tools
   - Vulnerability assessment

### Incident Response

1. **Response Plan**
   - Document incident response procedures
   - Establish communication channels
   - Define roles and responsibilities

2. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Backup and recovery plans
   - Key rotation procedures
   - System restoration processes
