# Admin Authentication Integration

This document describes the complete admin authentication system implemented for the Developer Portfolio Dashboard using Clerk authentication and role-based access control.

## Overview

The authentication system provides secure access to the admin dashboard with the following features:

- **Clerk Authentication**: Modern authentication with built-in security features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Database-backed admin role verification
- **Webhook Integration**: Optional webhook event logging and extensible user management
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware-based route protection
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite for authentication flows

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Clerk Integration** (`lib/clerk.ts`)
   - Server-side authentication utilities
   - Role-based access control functions
   - Admin context management

2. **Admin Service** (`lib/admin-service.ts`)
   - Database operations for admin users
   - Role verification and management
   - Admin statistics and reporting

3. **Middleware Protection** (`middleware.ts`)
   - Route-based authentication checks
   - Automatic redirects for unauthenticated users
   - Rate limiting and security headers

4. **Webhook Handler** (`app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`)
   - Basic webhook event logging and verification
   - Extensible structure for custom user management logic
   - Event handling for user lifecycle events

5. **Authentication Testing** (`lib/auth-test.ts`, `scripts/test-auth-setup.ts`)
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Database connectivity verification
   - Service operation validation

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Ensure the following environment variables are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication (Development Keys)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_development_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_development_key_here
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Clerk URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/admin/login
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/admin/login
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/admin/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/admin/dashboard

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
DATABASE_AUTHENTICATED_URL=postgresql://...
```

#### Build-Time Environment Variable Handling

The application includes intelligent environment variable handling that allows successful builds even when authentication keys are not available during build time. This is implemented in both the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) and authentication utilities (`lib/clerk.ts`).

**Root Layout Implementation (`app/layout.tsx`):**
- Performs build-time check for required Clerk environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- Conditionally renders ClerkProvider only when both keys are present
- Provides fallback layout without ClerkProvider when keys are missing
- Maintains all other functionality (SEO, structured data, error boundaries)

**Authentication Utilities (`lib/clerk.ts`):**
- `isClerkConfigured` constant determines Clerk availability at runtime
- All authentication functions gracefully handle missing configuration
- Return `null` or safe defaults when Clerk is not configured
- Prevent authentication-related errors during build time

**Build Scenarios:**
1. **With Clerk Keys**: Full authentication functionality and custom theming
2. **Without Clerk Keys**: Application builds successfully with auth features disabled

**Important Notes:**
- While the application can build without Clerk keys, authentication features will not function in production without proper environment variable configuration
- This feature enables CI/CD compatibility and preview deployments without exposing production secrets
- Always ensure proper environment variables are configured in production environments
- The fallback behavior is transparent to users - the app simply operates without authentication features

### 2. Database Setup

Initialize the database with admin tables:

```bash
npm run init-db
```

This creates the `admins` table with proper indexes and constraints.

### 3. Test Authentication Setup

Verify the complete authentication system:

```bash
npm run test-auth
```

This runs a comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Database connectivity
- Admin table structure
- Service operations (CRUD)
- Webhook configuration
- Environment variables

### 4. JWT Template Configuration

For secure API authentication and database integration (especially with NeonDB), configure a JWT template in Clerk:

#### Create JWT Template in Clerk Dashboard

Go to **Clerk Dashboard** → **JWT Templates** → **New template**

**Basic Information:**
- **Name**: `neon` (for NeonDB integration)
- **Token lifetime**: `60` seconds (short-lived for security)
- **Allowed clock skew**: `5` seconds

**Issuer Configuration:**
- **Issuer**: `https://clerk.creavibe.pro`
- **JWKS Endpoint**: `https://clerk.creavibe.pro/.well-known/jwks.json`

**Custom Signing Key:** ✅ Enabled

#### JWT Template Claims Configuration

Add these custom claims to your JWT template:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://clerk.creavibe.pro",
  "sub": "{{user.id}}",
  "aud": "neon",
  "exp": "{{token.exp}}",
  "iat": "{{token.iat}}",
  "nbf": "{{token.nbf}}",
  "user_id": "{{user.id}}",
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address.email_address}}",
  "role": "admin",
  "username": "{{user.username}}",
  "first_name": "{{user.first_name}}",
  "last_name": "{{user.last_name}}",
  "image_url": "{{user.image_url}}",
  "created_at": "{{user.created_at}}",
  "updated_at": "{{user.updated_at}}"
}
```

#### Environment Variables for JWT

Add the JWT template configuration to your environment:

```bash
# JWT Template Configuration
CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE_NAME=neon
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JWT_ISSUER=https://clerk.creavibe.pro
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JWKS_URL=https://clerk.creavibe.pro/.well-known/jwks.json
```

### 5. Clerk Webhook Configuration

Configure the Clerk webhook in your Clerk dashboard for event logging:

1. Go to Webhooks in your Clerk dashboard
2. Add endpoint: `https://creavibe.pro/api/webhooks/clerk`
3. Select events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`, `session.created`, `session.ended`
4. Copy the webhook secret to `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (already configured: `whsec_VaOtczmzcx5ENueijEw9otC6cMazbnVK`)

**Note**: The current webhook implementation provides basic event logging and verification. Extend the webhook handler in `app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` to add custom user management logic as needed.

## Authentication Flow

### User Registration/Login

1. User accesses `/admin/login`
2. Clerk handles authentication UI and process
3. On successful authentication, Clerk webhook fires (optional logging)
4. Admin role verification handled by `AdminService` during protected route access
5. User is redirected to `/admin/dashboard`

### Route Protection

1. User accesses protected route (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`)
2. Middleware checks Clerk authentication
3. If not authenticated, redirects to `/admin/login`
4. Page component calls `requireAdminAuth()` for role verification
5. If not admin role, redirects to login with error

### Admin Operations

1. Admin accesses dashboard or API routes
2. `getCurrentAdmin()` provides full admin context
3. Database operations use `AdminService` methods
4. All operations are logged and audited

## API Reference

### Clerk Utilities (`lib/clerk.ts`)

#### `requireAuth()`
Ensures user is authenticated, redirects to login if not.

```typescript
const userId = await requireAuth()
```

#### `requireAdminAuth()`
Ensures user is authenticated AND has admin role.

```typescript
const userId = await requireAdminAuth()
```

#### `getCurrentAdmin()`
Gets current user with admin data.

```typescript
const { clerkUser, adminData } = await getCurrentAdmin()
```

#### `isCurrentUserAdmin()`
Checks if current user has admin role.

```typescript
const isAdmin = await isCurrentUserAdmin()
```

### Admin Service (`lib/admin-service.ts`)

#### `getAdminByClerkId(clerkId: string)`
Retrieves admin record by Clerk ID.

#### `upsertAdmin(clerkId: string, email: string, name: string)`
Creates or updates admin record.

#### `deleteAdmin(clerkId: string)`
Removes admin record.

#### `isAdmin(clerkId: string)`
Checks if user has admin role.

#### `getAdminStats()`
Returns admin statistics and metrics.

## Security Features

### Authentication Security
- Clerk handles password security and hashing
- Built-in CSRF protection
- Automatic token refresh and expiration
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Data Protection
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection with content sanitization
- Rate limiting on all endpoints

### Infrastructure Security
- Environment variable protection
- Secrets management
- Database connection security
- TLS/SSL enforcement

### Security Best Practices

#### Environment Variable Security
- **Never commit production keys to version control**
- Use different keys for development (`pk_test_`, `sk_test_`) and production (`pk_live_`, `sk_live_`)
- Store production keys securely in your deployment platform's environment variable system
- Regularly rotate webhook secrets and API keys
- Use placeholder values in documentation and example files

#### Key Management
- Development keys should be used only in local development environments
- Production keys should be configured directly in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- Webhook secrets should be unique and regularly rotated
- Never expose keys in client-side code or public repositories

#### Access Control
- Implement proper role-based access control
- Use database-backed admin verification
- Monitor authentication attempts and failures
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Full authentication test suite
npm run test-auth

# Database initialization
npm run init-db

# Database reset (development only)
npm run reset-db
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Database connectivity and structure
- Admin service CRUD operations
- Webhook configuration validation
- Environment variable verification
- Role-based access control

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Unauthenticated Access**
   - Visit `/admin/dashboard` → Should redirect to `/admin/login`
   - Visit `/api/projects` → Should return 401 or redirect

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Sign up/in through Clerk → Should create admin record
   - Access dashboard → Should display admin interface
   - Sign out → Should clear session and redirect

3. **Role Verification**
   - Non-admin user access → Should show unauthorized error
   - Admin user access → Should grant full access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Variables Not Loading**
   - Ensure `.env.local` exists and is properly formatted
   - Check that variables don't have extra spaces or quotes
   - Restart development server after changes
   - **Build-Time Behavior**: Missing Clerk keys during build time will not cause failures due to graceful fallback implementation in `app/layout.tsx`
   - **Runtime Behavior**: Authentication features require proper environment variables to function in production

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
   - Check network connectivity to NeonDB
   - Ensure database exists and is accessible

3. **Webhook Not Working** (If Using Webhooks)
   - Verify webhook URL is accessible from internet
   - Check `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Clerk dashboard
   - Review webhook logs in Clerk dashboard
   - Check server logs for webhook processing errors
   - **Note**: Webhooks are optional - admin functionality works without them

4. **Authentication Redirects**
   - Ensure Clerk URLs are properly configured
   - Check middleware route matchers
   - Verify redirect URLs in environment variables

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test database connection
npm run test-auth

# Check environment variables
node -e "console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL ? 'DB URL set' : 'DB URL missing')"

# Verify Clerk configuration
node -e "console.log(process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY ? 'Clerk configured' : 'Clerk missing')"
```
