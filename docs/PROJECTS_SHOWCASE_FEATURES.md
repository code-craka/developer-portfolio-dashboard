## Code Examples

### Adding New Tech Stack Colors
```typescript
const techStackColors: Record<string, string> = {
  // Add new technology
  'Svelte': 'bg-orange-500/20 text-orange-400 border-orange-500/30',
  // ... existing colors
}
```

### Customizing Animation Timing
```typescript
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ 
    duration: 0.8, // Slower animation
    delay: index * 0.15, // Longer stagger delay
    ease: "easeOut" // Different easing
  }}
>
```

### Adding Project Filters
```typescript
const [selectedTech, setSelectedTech] = useState<string | null>(null)

const filteredProjects = projects.filter(project => 
  !selectedTech || project.techStack.includes(selectedTech)
)
```
